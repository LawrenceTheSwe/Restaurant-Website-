# Restaurant-Website-
A responsive restaurant landing page built with HTML and CSS, designed to demonstrate clean layout structure, responsive design, and modern UI polish — all without JavaScript.  This project is part of my front-end portfolio and focuses on real-world fundamentals: layout, responsiveness, accessibility, and maintainable CSS.

📱 Fully Responsive Design (desktop, tablet, mobile)

🍔 Clean, modern restaurant UI

📐 Flexbox-based layouts

🍔 Reusable card components

🌙 CSS-only Dark Mode Toggle

☰ CSS-only Hamburger Menu (No JavaScript)

🎨 Subtle hover effects for professional polish

🧼 Organized, readable, and scalable CSS structure

🛠️ Built With

HTML5 – Semantic markup

CSS3 – Flexbox, media queries, CSS variables

No JavaScript – All interactivity handled with pure CSS

📱 Responsive Design

The layout adapts smoothly across screen sizes:

Desktop: Full navigation, multi-column layouts

Tablet: Adjusted spacing and flexible grids

Mobile:

Stacked sections

Hamburger navigation menu

Optimized typography and spacing

Media queries are written to keep the desktop experience intact while improving usability on smaller screens.

☰ Hamburger Menu (CSS-Only)

The mobile navigation uses a pure CSS solution:

Hidden checkbox toggle

Label-based hamburger icon

CSS sibling selectors to control visibility

This demonstrates a solid understanding of CSS interactivity and accessibility without relying on JavaScript.

🎯 Purpose

This project was built to:

Practice responsive layouts

Apply clean CSS architecture

Demonstrate portfolio-ready front-end skills

Show how far core HTML/CSS can go without frameworks
