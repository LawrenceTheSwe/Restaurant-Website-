# Restaurant-Website-
A responsive restaurant landing page built with HTML and CSS, designed to demonstrate clean layout structure, responsive design, and modern UI polish — all without JavaScript.  This project is part of my front-end portfolio and focuses on real-world fundamentals: layout, responsiveness, accessibility, and maintainable CSS.
